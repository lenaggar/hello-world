# hello-world
This is my very first steps in the world of GitHub and in Computer Science in general. I would like to imagine that at some point in the near future I will look back at this repository and smile because then I would see how much have I evolved.

Hi
Lenaggar here from the planet of Egypt. I love programming eversince I knew about it and what I could do with it.
I really wish I can work out my way into this as I am not at all interested in the Integrity Engineering Field.
